          How does apple scab survive and spread?
        </h3>
        <p className="fs-6">
          Apple scab is caused by the fungus Venturia inaequalis. It infects
          crabapples and apples (Malus spp.), mountain ash (Sorbus spp.), pear
          (Pyrus communis) and Cotoneaster (Cotoneaster spp.).
        </p>
        <p className="fs-6">
          The apple scab fungus has several host-specific strains that can cause
          disease on one type of plant but not any other. For example, the
          strain of V. inaequalis that infects mountain ash will only infect
          other mountain ash trees and will not infect crabapple trees. Apple
          and crabapple trees are infected by the same strain of the apple scab
          fungus because the trees are in the same genus.

          Planting disease resistant varieties is the best way to prevent apple
          scab. Many varieties of apple and crabapple trees are resistant or

                  The apple scab fungus needs moisture on the leaves to start a
                  new infection. A well pruned tree with an open canopy allows
                  air to move through the tree and dry the leaves quickly. This
                  can help reduce the severity of apple scab in a tree. For
                  proper pruning of apples, see Growing apples in the home
                  garden.
